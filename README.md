# An Intuitive Introduction to Artificial Neural Network and Machine Learning

This repository provides collob notebooks that allow you to get your hands dirty and build an intution of Artificial Neural Networks and Machine Learning that supports the material for this course.

This is part of an introductory content to Artificial Neural Networks and Machine Learning that I am working on and there will be more content like this which aims to provide an intuitive introduction to artificial neural networks by hands-on implementation from scratch. It also avoids the fluff that you don't really need to know at an introductory level but you will be introduced to some theoretical concepts (if and only if) they can be demonstrated practically with ease.

### Motivation
There is a lot of content about neural networks, however sadly most of it is not beginner friendly. Additionally, to make matter worse, there is rarely any content that has the right blend of hands-on learning while looking at the nitty-gritty details with an open mind. 

The main aim of this book is to give you a simple and intuitive understanding of artificial neural network by presenting the nitty gritty details by hands on learning, and hopefully give you a mental feel of how they work. It focuses on the basic concepts of artificial neural networks and avoids the fat around the subject that I feel is one of the main reason people think that it is only for a select few with PhDs. By “fat”, I am referring to mathematical proofs and other advanced concepts not needed for anyone who wants to get a an understanding of how they work. Contrary to that, artificial neural networks are a shockingly simple concept considering the complex tasks they are able to learn including translating languages<REF>, describing images<REF> and even speaking like a human<REF>. I am betting that you will be shocked at how simple this mysterious algorithm is once we have a look at the nitty gritty without the clutter and build up to more contemporary concepts like deep learning. 

I also plan on taking you through a journey of how of some decisions made in the development of neural network libraries such as Keras and Tensroflow make sense.

### Learning Philosophy
Build an intuition for everything (a mental feel of how it works and how it will react to different things)
* Only Theory that can be demonstrated.
* Learn by Case study.
* Learn the nitty-gritty by hands-on implementation from scratch.
