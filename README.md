# An Intuitive Introduction to Artificial Neural Network and Machine Learning

This repository provides collob notebooks that allow you to get your hands dirty and build an intution of Artificial Neural Networks and Machine Learning that supports the material for this course.

This is part of an introductory content to Artificial Neural Networks and Machine Learning that I am working on and there will be more content like this which aims to provide an intuitive introduction to artificial neural networks by hands-on implementation from scratch. It also avoids the fluff that you don't really need to know at an introductory level but you will be introduced to some theoretical concepts (if and only if) they can be demonstrated practically with ease.
